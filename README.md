MACL - Multi-Agent Collaborative Learning

This simulator provides an N-dimensional environment where agents can
exist in, move around and pass messages to each other.

Agents can be distributed in many locations at once, and it is simple to
program them to have global knowledge or only local knowledge as you
wish.

A visualization for 2D environments is provided.
